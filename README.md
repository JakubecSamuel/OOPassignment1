# First OOP Assignment - Bang
## ⚡Languages: Java⚡
This is the first assignment from the OOP university class. In this assignment I had to create a simple card game inspired
by Bang. The game is played in a console, all the rules can be found in the README file inside "zadanie-1-bang-lite-JakubecSamuel" directory.
## This project had a deadline so there may appear some bugs because of the time limit and my knowledge at that time
